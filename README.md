# Mystery Word
This is the readme file for playing the Mystery_Word game

The purpose of the game is to guess a word by imputting letters.
The first request is for difficulty, in the form of word length. Users type 'e', 'n' or 'h' to select.

Once selected, the game is played by typing a letter. The output tells the user whether they guessed a correct letter or not.

The evil mode is supposed to work much the same way, it is not complete.
